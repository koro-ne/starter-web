Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around." Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores.

If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think. However, she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol suggestion.

They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Don't ask "Can I"… ask "I Can!"

Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it! Monday morning. COME ON! OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? They frame my junk. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me.

Monday morning. COME ON! I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch!

Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. George Bush doesn't care about black puppets. "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around."

The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom.

Let me out that Queen. What a fun, sexy time for you. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope.

I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi.

Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. I don't appreciate the dry British humor. Daddy horny, Michael.
